# Predicting Diabetes Using Medical Records Data

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether an individual has diabetes based on medical records. Using machine learning techniques, particularly **logistic regression**, the analysis identifies key factors contributing to diabetes diagnosis. The dataset used is the **Pima Indians Diabetes Database**, sourced from Kaggle.

## Motivation
Diabetes is a **chronic health condition** affecting millions worldwide. Early detection is crucial in managing and reducing its impact. This project leverages **data science** techniques to analyze medical records and improve prediction accuracy, which can assist **healthcare professionals** and individuals in making informed decisions.

## Research Questions
1. How can diabetes be predicted using medical records?
2. Why is data science important in detecting diabetes?
3. How accurate are the predictions from the model?
4. What trends in medical records correlate with diabetes?
5. Can data science provide personalized recommendations for diabetes prevention?

## Dataset
The primary dataset used is the **Pima Indians Diabetes Database**:
- Source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
- Originally from: **National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)**
- Features:
  - **Independent variables**: Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function, Age
  - **Dependent variable (Outcome)**: **1** (diabetic) or **0** (non-diabetic)

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Loaded the dataset and removed duplicates.
   - Handled missing values by replacing zeros with **mean** values (Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI).
   - Visualized data distributions using **histograms** and **box plots**.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Identified outliers in **Insulin** and other skewed features.
   - Checked for correlations between independent variables and diabetes.

3. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - Split data into **training (70%)** and **testing (30%)** sets.
   - Implemented **Logistic Regression** to classify diabetes presence.
   - Evaluated model using a **confusion matrix** and calculated accuracy.

## Model Performance
- **Accuracy**: **74.78%**
- **Key findings**:
  - **Glucose**, **BMI**, and **Diabetes Pedigree Function** were the most significant predictors.
  - **Pregnancies** and **Insulin** also contributed but were less significant.
  - **Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, and Age** were not strongly predictive.

## Required Packages
To run this project, install the following **R** packages:
```r
install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "tidyr", "caTools", "gridExtra"))
```
**Libraries used**:
```r
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(caTools)
library(gridExtra)
```

## Running the Project
1. **Load dataset**:
   ```r
   data <- read_csv("diabetes_data.csv")
   ```
2. **Preprocess data**:
   - Remove missing values and replace zeros.
   ```r
   clean_data <- data %>%
     mutate(
       Glucose = ifelse(Glucose == 0, mean(Glucose, na.rm = TRUE), Glucose),
       BloodPressure = ifelse(BloodPressure == 0, mean(BloodPressure, na.rm = TRUE), BloodPressure),
       SkinThickness = ifelse(SkinThickness == 0, mean(SkinThickness, na.rm = TRUE), SkinThickness),
       Insulin = ifelse(Insulin == 0, mean(Insulin, na.rm = TRUE), Insulin),
       BMI = ifelse(BMI == 0, mean(BMI, na.rm = TRUE), BMI)
     )
   ```
3. **Train logistic regression model**:
   ```r
   model <- glm(Outcome ~ ., data = train_data, family = binomial)
   summary(model)
   ```
4. **Predict and evaluate model**:
   ```r
   predicted_values <- predict(model, newdata = test_data, type = "response")
   predicted_classes <- ifelse(predicted_values > 0.5, 1, 0)
   confusion_matrix <- table(predicted_classes, test_data$Outcome)
   accuracy <- sum(diag(confusion_matrix)) / sum(confusion_matrix)
   print(paste("Accuracy:", accuracy))
   ```

## Insights & Implications
- **Higher glucose levels significantly increase diabetes risk.**
- **BMI and Diabetes Pedigree Function play a crucial role in diabetes prediction.**
- **Machine learning can be used in healthcare for early diagnosis.**
- **Healthcare professionals can integrate predictive models to identify high-risk individuals.**

## Limitations & Future Improvements
- **Dataset limitations**: Not representative of the entire population.
- **Model improvement**: Experimenting with **Random Forests** or **SVM** could improve accuracy.
- **Data quality**: More diverse and real-world datasets would enhance model robustness.

## Conclusion
This project successfully built a **logistic regression model** for predicting diabetes, achieving **74.78% accuracy**. The findings highlight key factors influencing diabetes and reinforce the potential of data science in healthcare decision-making.
